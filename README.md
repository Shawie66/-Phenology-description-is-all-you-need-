# Phenology description is all you need 
# This is the official implementation of "‘Phenological Descriptions Are All You Need!’ Mapping Unknown Crop Types Using Remotely Sensed Time Series and LLM-Generated Text Alignments”. This novel framework leverages visual and semantic knowledge to extract time-series information of each crop sample, and combine this framework to explore zero-shot crop classification across different regions for the first time.

Current Status 
Pre-trained Weights and Model Files: We have made the pre-trained weights and core model files available for immediate use. You can download them (link to be added) and start experimenting with the framework right away. 
Codebase: The current implementation includes the essential components to run the model. We are actively working on organizing and documenting the remaining parts of the codebase, which will be released as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates!
